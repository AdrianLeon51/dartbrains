# Project Gallery

Here is a gallery of projects that have been developed by Dartmouth undergraduates for the dartbrains course.

In Spring 2019, students developed an experiment to study the neural basis of how Dartmouth undergraduates process viewing memes. Twelve Dartmouth undergraduates were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing 76 memes. After viewing each meme, participants made a decision about whether they would likely share this meme with a friend or not. After the scanning session, participants rated each meme on a number of dimensions using a Qualtrics survey (e.g., relatability, enjoyment, type of meme, etc.).
