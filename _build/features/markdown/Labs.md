# Labs
This course is designed primarily around learning the basics of fMRI data analysis through interactive jupyter notebooks.

This course covers a lot of ground from introducing the Python programming language, to signal processing, to working with opensource packages from the Python Scientific Computing community.
We will not be covering everything and supplementing your learning via links to short videos, other readings, and more in depth tutorials and resources will be essential to mastering these topics.
