# Project Gallery

Here is a gallery of projects that have been developed by Dartmouth undergraduates for the dartbrains course.

In Spring 2019, students developed an experiment to study the neural basis of how Dartmouth undergraduates process viewing memes. Twelve Dartmouth undergraduates were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) while viewing 76 memes. After viewing each meme, participants made a decision about whether they would likely share this meme with a friend or not. After the scanning session, participants rated each meme on a number of dimensions using a Qualtrics survey (e.g., relatability, enjoyment, type of meme, etc.).

Unfortunately, we discovered that was a between run scanner artifact, which negatively impacted the results of all of the projects. Nevertheless, the questions and analytic approaches are very interesting and highlight the talent of Dartmouth undergraduates.

## Self-Referencing With Memes
Sarah Eger, Taylor Walsh, Serena Zhu

Memes have become a major phenomenon in recent years, due to individuals of all ages sharingthem across social media platforms. However, no study to date has evaluated the self-referential processing that occurs in response to relatable memes. Our research undertakes this topic through the analysis of functional MRI (fMRI) scans and behavioral data gathered from ten undergraduate students at Dartmouth College. The behavioral data facilitate the conclusion that 9 of the 76 memes presented in the study directly reference Dartmouth. These data also confirm that there is a statistically significant difference in relatability between these two categories of memes. The differences in activation to stimuli belonging to each of these classes were then evaluated using a univariate analysis of the fMRI scans. This analysis showed that some activation in the dmPFC and hypothalamus survived after thresholding the contrast between Dartmouth and non-Dartmouth memes. A Multivariate Pattern Analysis (MVPA) was also implemented to determine if a Support Vector Machine (SVM) could predict which stimulus class a participant was processing, based on activation patterns in the entire brain or individual regions of interest (ROI). Both the whole-brain and 50 ROI MVPAs suggest that no particular voxel or region of the brain accounts for the classification of the two types of memes more than others. However, this pilot study was limited by a small number of subjects and some flaws in the data collection. Therefore, the findings presented in this paper should be considered only as exploratory results that merit additional inquiry through future studies of self-referential processing in relation to relatable memes, Dartmouth or otherwise.
